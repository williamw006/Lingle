Translation APIs

What is an API?

“An application program interface is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.
The API specifies how software components should interact and APIs are used when programming graphical user interface
components. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts
the blocks together.”

Which API to get?

Google
Paid for. Quite cheap and you can set a limit on the number of translations to prevent abuse. Has 80 languages,
more work but more variety. Supposedly better at Spanish and French.

Bing
Free. As it is Microsoft it has MSDN (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff512421.aspx) if you prefer it.
Has 47 languages compared to Google, but are the missing languages important? This site (http://blog.linnworks.com/
google-bing-translate) says that Bing is better.
